# OOPs-Concepts-in-Python
Way to Understand OOPs

- <h3>Here's a brief and easy-to-understand explanation of the key OOP concepts in Python:</h3>


<h4>Class:</h4>
A blueprint for creating objects, which defines the attributes and behaviors that the objects will have.

<br>

<h4>Object:</h4>
An instance of a class, created by calling the class like a function. 
Each object has its own set of attributes and behaviors, based on the class from which it was created.

<br>
<h4>Inheritance:</h4>
 A mechanism for creating a new class that is a modified version of an existing class, inheriting its attributes and behaviors. 
 The new class is called a subclass, and the existing class is called the superclass.

<br>
<h4>Polymorphism:</h4>
  The ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, based on a shared interface or behavior. 
  This can be achieved through inheritance, as subclasses can inherit methods from their superclass, or through duck typing, 
  which allows objects to be treated as instances of a certain class as long as they have the required methods or attributes.
 <br>
 
<h4>Encapsulation:</h4>
  The practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, such as a class. 
  This protects the data from being accessed or modified outside of the class, and allows for more modular and organized code.

<br>
<h4>Abstraction:</h4>
  The practice of hiding the implementation details of a class or method from the user, and only exposing the essential features 
  and functionality. This allows for simpler and more user-friendly interfaces, and can make code more maintainable and flexible.

<h3>These concepts are fundamental to OOP in Python and are used extensively in the creation of programs and applications. 
By understanding these concepts, you can create well-designed and effective code that is easier to read, maintain, and expand.</h3>
